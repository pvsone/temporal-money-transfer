# Temporal Money Transfer

This is a simple project for demonstrating Temporal with the Go SDK and [Temporal Cloud](https://cloud.temporal.io).

This project is based on [money-transfer-project-template-go](https://github.com/temporalio/money-transfer-project-template-go) and the corresponding tutorial here: https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/first_program_in_go/

## Basic instructions

### Step 0: Temporal Cloud

This guide assumes you already have access to a Temporal Cloud account, as described in [How to get started with Temporal Cloud](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/how-to-get-started-with-temporal-cloud)

### Step 1: Clone this Repository

In a terminal instance, clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pvsone/temporal-money-transfer
cd pvsone-money-transfer
```

### Step 2: Issue CA Certificates

The Temporal docs provide options for [Issuing CA Certificates](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/how-to-get-started-with-temporal-cloud#issue-ca-certificates)

For this guide, we will use [certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap) to create a root CA and end-entity certificate.

_Note: In Step 3 of this guide, we will **Create a Namespace**, during which we will supply a value for 
the Namespace Name.  We will use the Namespace Name as the Common Name of the end-entity certificate
that is created here in Step 2._

```bash
# set the Namespace Name for use as the Common Name in the certstrap commands below
export NAMESPACE_NAME=my-namespace

# Initialize a new certificate authority
certstrap init --common-name "My Cert Auth"

# Request a certificate, with a common name equal to the namespace name
certstrap request-cert --common-name ${NAMESPACE_NAME}

# Sign certificate request and generate the end-entity certificate
certstrap sign ${NAMESPACE_NAME} --CA "My Cert Auth"
```

### Step 3: Create a Namespace

Follow the steps at [Create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud/#create-a-namespace-in-temporal-cloud).  In addition set the following field values:
* Set **CA Certificates** field value to the contents of the file `out/My_Cert_Auth.crt`.
* Set **Certificate Filters** > **Filter 1** > **Common Name** field value to the value of $NAMESPACE_NAME defined above, e.g. `my-namespace`

The **Certificate Filter** ensures that only the end-entity certificate that we created in Step 2
can be used to access this Namespace.  Without the filter in place then _any_ certificate signed 
and generated by the "My Cert Auth" could be used to access this Namespace.

After successful creation, the Namespace will be given a unique Id of the form `<namespace_name>.<account_id>`, e.g. `my-namespace.a1bc2`.  Export this value as environment variable in your shell for use in commands in subsequent steps.

```bash
# replace 'a1bc2' with your account id
export ACCOUNT_ID=a1bc2
export NAMESPACE_ID=${NAMESPACE_NAME}.${ACCOUNT_ID}
```

### Step 4: Run the Workflow

```bash
go run start/main.go \
  -client-cert ./out/${NAMESPACE_NAME}.crt \
  -client-key ./out/${NAMESPACE_NAME}.key \
  -target-host ${NAMESPACE_ID}.tmprl.cloud:7233 \
  -namespace ${NAMESPACE_ID}
```

Observe that Temporal Cloud Web UI reflects the workflow, but it is still in "Running" status. This is because there is no Workflow or Activity Worker yet listening to the `TRANSFER_MONEY_TASK_QUEUE` task queue to process this work.

### Step 5: Run the Worker

In another terminal instance, run the worker. Notice that this worker hosts both Workflow and Activity functions.

```bash
# export environment variables 
export NAMESPACE_NAME=my-namespace
export ACCOUNT_ID=a1bc2
export NAMESPACE_ID=${NAMESPACE_NAME}.${ACCOUNT_ID}

go run worker/main.go \
  -client-cert ./out/${NAMESPACE_NAME}.crt \
  -client-key ./out/${NAMESPACE_NAME}.key \
  -target-host ${NAMESPACE_ID}.tmprl.cloud:7233 \
  -namespace ${NAMESPACE_ID}
```

Now you can see the workflow run to completion.
